#s = ['yut', 'yi', 'sam', 'sei', 'um', 'look', 'qut', 'bat', 'gao', 'sup']
#for i in s:
#	print(i)
#	if i == 'sam':
#		break
#This lets me know that the code has to run through everything within the same tab level before
#proceeding, that's why it will stop/break wherever I put the break at.
#for i in s:
#	if i == 'sam':
#		continue
#	print(i)
#This code is for skipping exactly the elements that I make i == to, in this case it runs
#through all of the numbers except for three
#for _ in range(_) starts from 0 to 1 below the final numbers
#for _ in range(_,_) Starts at the designated number on the left and stops one number before max
#names = ['troll', 'pepe', 'peepo']
#for i, name in enumerate(names): Enumeration is for keeping track of number of itterations 
#that have occured
#	i += 1 This line makes it so i starts at 1 instead of 0
#	print(i,name)
#point = [
#	(1,5), (10,13), (123,431)
#]
#for i, s in point: This is just for printing the coordinates together on the same line
#	print(i,s)
#columns = ['name', 'shares', 'price']
#values = ['GOOG', 100, 490.1]
#pairs = zip(columns, values) Zip makes it so pairs is = ('name', 'GOOG'), ('shares', 100), ('price', 490.1) which can not be printed on it's own unless you use a for function
#print(columns) prints the different column names
#print(values) prints the number values
#for column, value in pairs:
#	print(column, value)
#zip is good for making dictionaries Ex. d = dict(zip(columns, values))
