<!-- When I first learned Python nearly 25 years ago, I was immediately struck by how I could productively apply it to all sorts of messy work projects.Fast-forward a decade and I found myself teaching others the same fun.The result of that teaching is this course--A no-nonsense treatment of Python that has been actively taught to more than 400 in-person groups since 2007.Traders, systems admins, astronomers,tinkerers, and even a few hundred rocket scientists who used Python to help land a rover on Mars--they've all taken this course. Now, I'm pleased to make it available under a Creative Commons license. Enjoy! -->

大约25年前，当我第一次学 Python 时，我直接被如何有效地将其应用在复杂的工作项目中震撼到了。快进十年，我发现教别人同样有趣。教学的成果就是这门课程--一门毫无废话的 Python 课程，自2007年以来，已经有400多人参加了这门课程学习。交易员、系统管理员、天文学家、修补匠，甚至数百名使用 Python 帮助火星探测器着陆的火箭科学家——他们都参加了这门课程。现在，我很高兴在知识共享许可证下提供它。Enjoy!

<!-- ## What is This? -->
## 这是啥？

<!-- The material you see here is the heart of an instructor-led Python training course used for corporate training and professional
development. It has been in continual development since 2007 and
battle tested in real-world classrooms.  Usually, it's taught
in-person over the span of three or four days--requiring approximately 25-35 hours of intense work. This includes the completion of approximately 130 hands-on coding exercises. -->
您在这里看到的材料是用于企业培训和专业开发培训班的核心 Python 教程。它从2007年持续发展至今，并经过真实课堂的实战检验。通常情况下，它需要三到四天的时间面对面教授——大约25-35小时的紧张工作，包括完成大约130个动手编码练习。

<!-- ## Target Audience -->
## 目标用户

<!-- Students of this course are usually professional scientists,
engineers, and programmers who already have experience in at least one other programming language. No prior knowledge of Python is required, but knowledge of common programming topics is assumed.  Most participants find the course challenging--even if they've already been doing a bit of Python programming. -->
这门课程的学生通常是专业的科学家、工程师，以及至少拥有一种其他编程语言经历的程序员。不需要 Python 的先验知识，但需要了解常见的编程术语。大多数学员都认为这门课程具有挑战性--即使他们已经做了一定的 Python 编程经历。

<!-- ## Course Objectives -->
## 课程目标

<!-- The goal of this course is to cover foundational aspects of Python programming with an emphasis on script writing, data manipulation, and program organization.  By the end of this course, students should be
able to start writing useful Python programs on their own or be able to understand and modify Python code written by their
coworkers. -->
本课程的目标是涵盖 Python 编程的基础方面，重点是脚本编写、数据操作和程序组织。学习完本课程后，学生应该具备自主编写有用的 Python 程序的能力、具备理解并修改同事写的 Python 代码的能力。

<!-- ## Requirements -->
## 要求

<!-- To complete this course, you need nothing more than a basic
installation of Python 3.6 or newer and time to work on it. -->
要完成本课程，您只需要安装 Python 3.6 或更高版本，并有足够的时间就可以了。

<!-- ## What This Course is Not -->
## 本课程不能干什么

<!-- This is not a course for absolute beginners on how to program a computer.  It is assumed that you already have programming experience in some other programming language or Python itself. -->
这不是一门教小白如何编写计算机程序的课程。这门课程假设您已经具备了一定的其他语言或 Python 本身的编程经验。

<!-- This is not a course on web development.  That's a different
circus. However, if you stick around for this circus, you'll still see some interesting acts--just nothing involving animals. -->
这不是一门网站开发课程。网站开发是另一个不同的圈子。 然而，如果你坚持要混这个圈子，你仍然会得到一些有趣的知识——只是没有涉及Web。

<!-- This is not a course for software engineers on how to write or
maintain a one-million line Python application. I don't write programs like that, nor do most companies who use Python, and neither should you. Delete something already! -->
这不是一门教授软件攻城狮如何编写、管理具有百万行代码的 Python 应用的课程。我不会写那样的程序，大部分使用 Python 的公司也不会，你也不应该。

## Questions and Answers

### Q: Are there course videos I can watch?

No. This course is about you writing Python code, not watching someone else.

### Q: How is this course licensed?

Practical Python Programming is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

### Q: May I use this material to teach my own Python course?

Yes, as long as appropriate attribution is given.

### Q: May I make derivative works?

Yes, as long as such works carry the same license terms and provide attribution.

### Q: Can I translate this to another language?

Yes, that would be awesome.  Send me a link when you're done.

### Q: Can I live-stream the course or make a video?

Yes, go for it!  You'll probably learn a lot of Python doing that.

### Q: Why wasn't topic X covered?

There is only so much material that you can cover in 3-4 days.  If
it wasn't covered, it was probably because it was once covered and it
caused everyone's head to explode or there was never enough time to
cover it in the first place.   Also, this is a course, not a Python
reference manual.

### Q: Do you accept pull requests?
